# set-default-user-in-wordpress
You can set the default user by coding on the WordPress website, it will be very useful for you because if a buyer does not want to pay and delete you as a user, then you can access his website again with this user access.

#How to implement these codes
01. First check which theme is activated on the website you are working on
02. Then go to Theme File Editor
03. The theme that is activated will be set as default, you just find and click function.php
04. Go to the bottom of this file and paste the code of the default user.php file without the PHP block.
05. Contact me if you have any problem inzams.hp@gmail.com
